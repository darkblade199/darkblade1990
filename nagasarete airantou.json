  "description": "Ikuto Touhohin just had a last fight with his old man, one that led him to make a rash decision to run away from home. He boards a ship, deciding to take a vacation, but the ship is suddenly hit by a huge stormâ€“one that sends Ikuto overboard! When he regains consciousness, he realizes he is still alive... on some island. An isolated island. An isolated island with nothing but girls. Stranded on an island with only girls, no electricity, gas, radio, television... like he was back in the stone age.\n\n",
